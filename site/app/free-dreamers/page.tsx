            Hugo came up with the Free Dreamers on a retreat. The name
            is deliberate - this is a community for people who want to
            dream freely about what {place.name} could do with AI, and
            then go and try it. The boundaries of who&rsquo;s involved
            matter; a tight room makes bold ideas safe.
