            We&rsquo;re asking the council to be a full partner - and

            {place.wordmark} only works if every resident hears about it.
            The council is the single largest awareness-building asset
            this {noun} has - its socials, email lists, direct mail,
            community boards, venue networks, and trusted
            relationships. None of those can be replicated by paid
            marketing, and all of them are needed if we&rsquo;re
            serious about reaching every {place.name} resident, not
            just the ones already paying attention.

            This page is written for council members and officers.
            It collects the partnership asks, inventories the assets
            we&rsquo;d use together, spells out what we&rsquo;re
            <em> not</em> asking for, and outlines the council-specific
            variant of the AI Transformation Accelerator.

            email, every noticeboard, every meeting - is a chance to
            move that number. The programme delivers fluency. The
            partnership delivers awareness. Both have to win for either

                <strong>No editorial control surrendered.</strong> The
